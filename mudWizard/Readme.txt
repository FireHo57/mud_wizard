The top directory of a mud based wizard game written in python!

Current Directory Layout:

This folder is intended to contain everything relating to the game engine and mechanics.

Networking-
This folder contains everythign to do with handling connections, disconnections and communication over networks.

test-
Sometimes I'd like to just 'test' bits of code and keep them around for refernce material. In which case they're going to be committed here.
