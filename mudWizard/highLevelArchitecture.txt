Just a bit of a design document that will proabably get changed quite a lot.

Basic concept:

MUD WIZARD!

it's a multi user dungeon full of wizards!

I was thinking you could start in something called the 'firmament';
that is pure unmolded creative potential.

I quite like the idea of players being able to create their own 'worlds'
from the firmamanet complete with their own specific ruleset (like no combat or
everythign must be the derivative of a bunny or something) haven't quite worked out how that's going to work.

each player would be the 'God' of their 'world' and have complete control over
entrance and exit (forcible or otherwise) of every creature inside.


craft spells from a basic starting set?

Implementation:

-python based
-use the asyncio library
-ascii gui elements
-top down (for now, as is above)

OK.

LETS GO.
